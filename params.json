","body":"## ChartAdvisor: Efficient Algorithm for Recommendation of Data Visualization Tools.\r\nChart Advisor is a standalone software that processes an Input RDF Dataset and produces as result a ranked list of recommended visualization tools (charts) such as Pie, Column, Line charts (and [others](https://github.com/CristoLeiva/Algorithm_forCharts_Recommendation/wiki/Technical-Documentation#3-data-structure)). The core algorithm of the software is intended to be used by Linked Data Projects ([LinDa](http://linda-project.eu/)) and similar solutions.\r\n\r\nThis is a Lab project developed by a team of students of Master in Computer Science at Universit√§t Bonn.   \r\n\r\n[![](https://github.com/CristoLeiva/Algorithm_forCharts_Recommendation/blob/master/wiki_resources/front/front.jpg)](https://youtu.be/v7hBu5nNlFI)\r\n\r\n## Content\r\n* [Technical Documentation](https://github.com/CristoLeiva/Algorithm_forCharts_Recommendation/wiki/Technical-Documentation)\r\n* [User Manual](https://github.com/CristoLeiva/Algorithm_forCharts_Recommendation/wiki/User-Manual)\r\n* [Testing Results](https://github.com/CristoLeiva/Algorithm_forCharts_Recommendation/wiki/Testing-Results)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
